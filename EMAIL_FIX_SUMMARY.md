# Email Delivery Issue - FIXED ✅

## 🔍 Problem Identified

**Issue:** Company owner was NOT receiving notification emails when customers submitted contact forms.

**Customer Experience:**
- ✅ Customer fills form with email: `qureshi.mgrid@gmail.com`
- ✅ Customer RECEIVES auto-reply: "Thank You for Reaching Out!"
- ❌ Company owner (`qureshianas8486@gmail.com`) NOT receiving notification

**Root Cause:**
Emails were being sent to the **WRONG email address**!

---

## 🛠️ What Was Wrong

In `config/email.config.js`, line 24:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Wrong)
primary: 'alcoaaluminiumscaffolding1@gmail.com',  // ❌ Wrong address
```

**The code was sending notifications to `alcoaaluminiumscaffolding1@gmail.com` instead of `qureshianas8486@gmail.com`!**

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated `config/email.config.js`
```javascript
// AFTER (Correct)
const recipients = {
  primary: 'qureshianas8486@gmail.com',  // ✅ Correct address
  secondary: process.env.SECONDARY_EMAIL || 'qureshianas8486@gmail.com',
  support: process.env.SUPPORT_EMAIL || 'qureshianas8486@gmail.com'
};
```

### 2. Updated `config/app.config.js`
```javascript
// AFTER (Correct)
email: {
  responseTime: '2 hours',
  emergencyHotline: '+971 58 137 5601',
  supportEmail: 'qureshianas8486@gmail.com',  // ✅ Correct
  companyName: 'Alcoa Aluminium Scaffolding',
  companyAddress: 'Musaffah, Abu Dhabi, UAE',

}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Check Spam Folder
Both emails might go to spam initially. If you don't see them in inbox:
1. Check **Spam/Junk folder**
2. Mark as "Not Spam"
3. Add sender to contacts

### Server Restart
The changes take effect immediately because nodemon auto-restarts the server when files change.

If server didn't restart automatically:
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

---

## 📊 Verification

### Check Server Logs
When an email is sent, you should see in the console:

```
✅ Email sent - Type: Contact Form
To: qureshianas8486@gmail.com, qureshi.mgrid@gmail.com
```

Make sure it shows `qureshianas8486@gmail.com` not `alcoaaluminiumscaffolding1@gmail.com`

### Check Email Headers
When you receive the email, check the "To:" field:
- ✅ Should be: `qureshianas8486@gmail.com`
- ❌ Should NOT be: `alcoaaluminiumscaffolding1@gmail.com`
